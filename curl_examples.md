## Example: Register → Login → Get User Info

```bash
# 1. Register
REGISTER_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",

    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "role": "supplier"
  }')

echo "Registration Response: $REGISTER_RESPONSE"

# 2. Login
LOGIN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"

echo "Login Response: $LOGIN_RESPONSE"

# Extract token (requires jq)
TOKEN=$(echo $LOGIN_RESPONSE | jq -r '.access_token')
echo "Token: $TOKEN"

# 3. Get user info
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Forwarder Routes (Requires JWT Token - Forwarder Role)

### Show Available Shipments (Without Forwarder)
Get all shipments that don't have a forwarder assigned yet (available for bidding).

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/show-shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**One-liner:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/show-shipments -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Get Forwarder Profile
Get the current forwarder's profile information.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/my-profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**One-liner:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/my-profile -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Accept Shipment Request (Submit Quote)
Accept a shipment request by submitting a quote. This assigns the forwarder to the shipment.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/request-accept/SHIPMENT_ID_HERE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "quote_amount": 5000.00,
    "quote_time": "2025-12-27T12:00:00Z",
    "quote_extra": "Additional notes or conditions"
  }'
```

**Minimal request (quote_amount only):**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/request-accept/SHIPMENT_ID_HERE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "quote_amount": 5000.00
  }'
```

**One-liner:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/forwarder/request-accept/SHIPMENT_ID_HERE -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -d '{"quote_amount":5000.00}'
```

**Note:** 
- `quote_amount` is required
- `quote_time` is optional (ISO 8601 format)
- `quote_extra` is optional (additional notes)
- Only works for shipments without a forwarder assigned (`forwarder_id` is null)
- Sets `quote_status` to 'accepted' and assigns the forwarder to the shipment

## Carrier Routes (Requires JWT Token)

### Get All Quotes (Quoted Shipments)
Get all shipments with status 'quoted' for the current user (supplier).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/carriers/AllQuotes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{}'
```

**One-liner:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/carriers/AllQuotes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -d '{}'
```

**Note:**
- Returns all shipments where `status='quoted'` and `supplier_id` matches the authenticated user
- Requires JWT authentication
- Request body can be empty `{}` or any valid JSON
